# **App Name**: CodeLoop

## Core Features:

- Code Generation: Convert natural language prompts into running code.
- Authentication: Secure user authentication using email.
- Code Execution: Run generated code snippets directly within the playground.
- AI Explainer Tool: Line-by-line explanation of the generated code, tailored to user's experience level (junior/mid/senior).
- Auto-Saving: Automatically save every generated code to the user's account.
- Forking: Fork any existing code to iterate on it with a new prompt.
- My Loops: User Interface (UI) for managing and accessing saved code generations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of intellect and sophistication.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5), near the indigo hue, providing a clean and focused workspace.
- Accent color: Amber (#FFC107), a warm color analogous to indigo, used for interactive elements and highlights, ensuring key functions stand out.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Space Grotesk provides a tech-focused feel for titles, while Inter ensures readability for longer descriptions and code explanations.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets clearly and legibly.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons for navigation and actions, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
- Divide the interface into three main panels: code generation prompt, code display/execution, and AI explainer. Each section has clearly defined boundaries, but the sections should feel well-integrated.
- Subtle animations when generating code, loading explanations, and running code.
